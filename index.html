      <h3> Reading </h3>
      <div>
        </div>
      <p> Reading is a great habit to be a complete man. Reading helps to communicate with the outside world. Moreover, it's a kind of entertainment which entertains as well as develops communicating skills and vocabulary. I love reading ,especially the space encyclopedias. Reading Books also tells interesting facts about the world and universe. I am 12 years old and I'm in class 7. I love reading that mystery books, funny books and books full of suspense. A book is a kind of friend that acknowledge us without making us know that he is teaching us a lot of things. <br> So, I request all to give atleast 30 mins of their routine on reading books. </p>

      <h3> Gardening </h3>
      <div>
        </div>
      <p> When I don't use to read I use to take care of my plants. This is another good habit of being a nature lover. We should give time to the one that has created us. It always feels good to live amidst the green grasses and fresh air. It makes our mind fresh and calm after the busy life. I love gardening. Trying to produce small fruits, vegetables and flowers is really a great experience. Trees give us life so a little bit time will surely worth. I was greatly inspired by a quote said by Frank Lloyd Wright, He told that "I believe in God, only I spell it Nature." <br> So, please take out a little bit of time and cherish the beauty around you.  </p>
